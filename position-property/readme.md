# CSS Position Property Project
This project demonstrates the use of the CSS position property, showcasing how different positioning values affect the placement of elements on a webpage.


## What is the Position Property?
The position property in CSS is used to specify how an element is positioned in the document. It determines the element’s place in the normal flow and how it behaves in relation to its surroundings.
The main position values are:

  - Static – Default position (follows normal document flow)
  - Relative – Positioned relative to its normal position
  - Absolute – Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
  - Fixed – Positioned relative to the viewport; stays in place when scrolling
  - Sticky – Scrolls with the page until a defined threshold is met


##  What I Learned
  - How each position value works
  - Using top, bottom, left, and right with positioned elements
  - Layering elements using z-index and using transform property
  - Creating fixed headers and sticky sections
  - Absolute positioning inside relatively positioned containers
