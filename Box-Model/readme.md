# 📦 CSS Box Model Project
This project is a simple demonstration created to practice and understand the CSS Box Model — an essential concept in web design and layout.

## 🌐 What is the Box Model?
The CSS Box Model describes how the size of elements is determined on a webpage. Each HTML element can be considered a box, which consists of:

  1.  Content – The actual content of the box (text, image, etc.)
  2.  Padding – Space between the content and the border
  3.  Border – A line surrounding the padding (if any)
  4.  Margin – Space outside the border, separating it from other elements
  5.  Understanding and mastering the Box Model is crucial for precise layout control in web development.


## 🧑‍💻 What I Learned
  - Setting width and height of elements
  - Applying margin and padding
  - Center aligning the contents using box-model
  - Using different border styles
