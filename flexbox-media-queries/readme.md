# CSS Flexbox & Media Queries 
This project demonstrates the use of **CSS Flexbox** in combination with **Media Queries** to create flexible, responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly across various screen sizes.

## Overview

- **Flexbox** enables one-dimensional layout control â€” great for arranging items in a row or column and distributing space.
- **Media Queries** allow the design to adapt based on screen size, device type, or orientation, making it responsive and mobile-friendly.

Together, these tools are essential for building modern, responsive web interfaces.
